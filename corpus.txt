About Us

The Department of Informatics (Institut für Informatik, IfI) is the competence center for Informatics at the University of Zurich. Ten tenured professors, five assistant professors, and approximately 100 PhD students and postdoctoral researchers instruct and conduct research at the department. They are supported by approximately twelve administrative and technical staff.

IfI is a leading department whose scope extends beyond classical computer science to a new domain that focuses on both computing and human aspects. We address topics such as the aging society, privacy and value creation in a digital age, corporate and societal innovation, and sustainable development as well as the underlying technical challenges of building and understanding large-scale, software-based systems.

IfI concentrates its research on three focus areas: People-Oriented Computing, Computing and Economics, and Big Data Analytics for Economics and the Sciences. We also do research in other areas that are in line with the department’s vision of shaping a human-oriented digital world. Our research results in world-class publications as well as in systems and innovations that help people solve real world problems.

We offer BSc, MSc and PhD programs in Informatics with concentrations in Business Informatics/Information Systems, Software Systems, People-Oriented Computing (as of fall 2016), Computing and Economics (as of fall 2016), Informatics with Sciences (BSc only), and Data Science (MSc only). Currently, about 450 students are enrolled in our programs.

We are part of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Informatics, which consists of the departments of Economics, Business Administration, Banking & Finance, and Informatics.

The department was founded in 1970 and has grown since from a single chair into a vibrant, internationally recognized place of excellent research and teaching.
